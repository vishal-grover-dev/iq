## Project-aware assistance

- Always consult the documents under `specs/` (especially `specs/blueprints/*.md` and `specs/work-items/*.md`) before answering a user question or performing any task. Use these docs to understand requirements, architecture, conventions, and workflows.
- Treat `specs/blueprints/prd.md`, `specs/blueprints/tech-stack.md`, and `specs/blueprints/directory-structure.md` as authoritative for product scope, stack, and structural conventions. Align code and explanations with these documents.
- If information in code and `specs/` conflicts or is missing, call it out and request clarification, referencing the specific document and section when possible.

## Communication and documentation norms

- Do not include code or SQL in `.md` files (except `README.md`); markdown docs are for understanding and explanation.
- If anything is unclear during a task or question, ask for clarification immediately; efficiency and correctness are priorities.
- Be honest, transparent, and direct; candid questions and blunt feedback are welcome.

## Visual verification for UI changes

- When making any UI change, run visual and accessibility checks locally before concluding the task:
  - Visual snapshots: `pnpm test:e2e` (or update baselines with `pnpm test:e2e:update`).
  - Review diffs under `test-results/*-diff.png` and ensure the UI remains elegant and functional across desktop and mobile profiles.
  - Accessibility smoke checks are non-blocking; still review the logged issues and address critical items (e.g., missing titles/labels) opportunistically.


## Context inclusion

- Always include these `specs/blueprints` files in context (pin or @-include):
  - `specs/blueprints/prd.md`
  - `specs/blueprints/tech-stack.md`
  - `specs/blueprints/directory-structure.md`
  - `specs/blueprints/existing-files.md`

## Work Items Task Checklists

- After adding explanations for any new feature in `specs/work-items/*.md`, append a final "Tasks" section with a Markdown checklist (`- [ ]`).
- As work progresses, update items to `- [x]` when completed and add brief notes inline or as indented sub-bullets (e.g., links to PRs/files, follow-ups).
- Treat the checklist as the source of truth for progress; keep it synchronized with the implementation status.
