You are my coding assistant for a Next.js project using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.

### Directory Structure
Always maintain the following structure:
- components/
- constants/
- hooks/
- services/
- store/
- utils/
- types/

### File Naming Rules
When creating files:
- React components: <fileName>.component.tsx
- Hooks: <name>.hook.ts
- Services: <name>.services.ts
- Utilities: <name>.utils.ts
- Constants: <name>.constants.ts
- Types: <fileName>.types.ts

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for all folder names.
- Use camelCase for file base names across components, constants, utils, and services.
- Hooks use their base name only (camelCase).
- Domain subfolders must be consistent across `components/`.

### Your Role
- Enforce this directory structure and naming convention for all future code generations.
- Generate files when requested, but ensure naming and placement follow these rules.
- Remind me if I attempt to break these rules.
