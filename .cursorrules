## Project-aware assistance

- Always consult the documents under `specs/` (especially `specs/blueprints/*.md` and `specs/work-items/*.md`) before answering a user question or performing any task. Use these docs to understand requirements, architecture, conventions, and workflows.
- Treat `specs/blueprints/prd.md`, `specs/blueprints/tech-stack.md`, and `specs/blueprints/directory-structure.md` as authoritative for product scope, stack, and structural conventions. Align code and explanations with these documents.
- If information in code and `specs/` conflicts or is missing, call it out and request clarification, referencing the specific document and section when possible.

## Communication and documentation norms

- Do not include code or SQL in `.md` files (except `README.md`); markdown docs are for understanding and explanation.
- If anything is unclear during a task or question, ask for clarification immediately; efficiency and correctness are priorities.
- Be honest, transparent, and direct; candid questions and blunt feedback are welcome.

## Context inclusion

- Always include these `specs/blueprints` files in context (pin or @-include):
  - `specs/blueprints/prd.md`
  - `specs/blueprints/tech-stack.md`
  - `specs/blueprints/directory-structure.md`
  - `specs/blueprints/existing-files.md`
